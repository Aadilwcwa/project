# Pig Game

Welcome to the Pig Game! This is a simple Python implementation of the classic dice game, Pig. In this game, players take turns rolling a die to accumulate points, but if they roll a 1, they lose their turn and any points accumulated during that turn.

## Introduction

The Pig Game is a turn-based dice game where players aim to be the first to reach a target score. On each turn, a player rolls a die and adds the result to their score for that turn. If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose the points accumulated during that turn. The game ends when a player reaches the winning score (here 50 is target).

## Features
